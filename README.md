# Sprint 01: Obtain genes
---
**GOAL:**
Get the 308 genes from orphanet and retrive manually the html table genes
# Sprint 02: Generate table of genes
---
**GOAL:**
Generate a csv table file with links to ensembl, chromossome region, ensembl id for each gene form sprint 01 output (links_genes.html)
---
# Sprint 03: analyze in ensembl the genes from table of genes
---
**GOAL:**
Analyze manually each one of the 308 genes in ensembl storaged in sprint 02 output (gene_link-orphanet_link-ensembl_id-ensembl_chromossome.csv). Get pathogenic variants of each gene analyzed in ensembl variant predictor and get population of these variants
---
# Sprint 04: data analysis of the genes analysis
---
**GOAL:**
Visualize outputs of the output of the sprint 03 (analysis of the genes) or even obtain metrics from them. It includes essensially analyse the frequency of the variants in the populations
